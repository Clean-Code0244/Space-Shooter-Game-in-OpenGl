Initialization and Game Window Settings:

The game window is initialized using the GLUT library in the main function.
The window title is set to "Space Shooter".
The initial size of the game is set to 800x600 pixels.
Variables and Constants:

Variables and constants used within the game are defined.
MAX_BULLETS: Maximum number of bullets that can be on the screen at the same time.
ENEMY_COUNT: Number of enemies that can be visible on the screen at the same time.
BASE_ENEMY_SPEED: Initial speed of enemies.
Drawing Game Objects:

Game objects are drawn using the drawPlayer, drawBullet, and drawEnemy functions.
The spaceship, bullets, and enemies are drawn with different colors and geometric shapes.
Game Initialization and Initial Object Positions:

The initializeGame function sets up the initial state of the game.
The spaceship's initial position is centered and placed at a fixed height above.
The initial positions of bullets and enemies are randomly determined.
Player Movements:

The movePlayer function allows the player to move based on keyboard inputs.
The player moves left and right using the left and right arrow keys.
Firing Bullets:

The fireBullet function enables the player to shoot bullets.
Pressing the spacebar fires a bullet.
Movement of Objects:

The moveBullets and moveEnemies functions control the movement of bullets and enemies.
Bullets move downward from the top of the screen, while enemies move upward from the bottom.
Collision Detection:

The checkCollision function checks if two objects collide.
It checks for collisions between bullets and enemies and between the player and enemies.
Game State and Screen Updates:

The display function draws the game screen.
If the game is ongoing, the player, bullets, enemies, and score are drawn on the screen.
When the game ends, "GAME OVER!" and the score are displayed on the screen.
The update function periodically updates the game screen.
Keyboard Inputs:

The keyboard and specialKeyboard functions handle keyboard inputs.
Pressing the spacebar fires bullets, and the left and right arrow keys move the player.
This way, your code creates a simple space shooter game where the player controls a spaceship to evade enemies and destroy them. 
The player earns points by shooting enemies with bullets, and if enemies hit the player, the player loses health. 
If the player loses all health, the game ends.
